# Project 4 - Tori

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Hamburger menu
   - [x] Dragging anywhere in the view should reveal the menu.
   - [x] The menu should include links to your profile, the home timeline, and the mentions view.
   - [x] The menu can look similar to the example or feel free to take liberty with the UI.
- [x] Profile page
   - [x] Contains the user header view
   - [x] Contains a section with the users basic stats: # tweets, # following, # followers
- [x] Home Timeline
   - [x] Tapping on a user image should bring up that user's profile page

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Profile Page
   - [x] Implement the paging view for the user description.
   - [ ] As the paging view moves, increase the opacity of the background screen. See the actual Twitter app for this effect
   - [ ] Pulling down the profile page should blur and resize the header image.
- [ ] Account switching
   - [ ] Long press on tab bar to bring up Account view with animation
   - [ ] Tap account to switch to
   - [ ] Include a plus button to Add an Account
   - [ ] Swipe to delete an account


The following **additional** features are implemented:
- [x] UI/UX
   - [x] Added icons for menu and new tweet
   - [x] Tap hamburger icon to open and close menu
   - [x] Animate logout
   - [x] Display user tweets in profile scene (tap stat to see)
   - [x] Display followers in profile scene (tap stat to see)
   - [x] Display following (friends) in profile scene (tap stat to see)
   - [x] Improved look of login scene
   - [x] Created custom app logo and icon
   - [x] Profile layout was implemented to ensure that the user can read the user name, screen name, description regardless ot the background color of their banner image. I intended to use the `profile_text_color` value, but realized that few users set it. CodePath, for example, uses a dark banner image, but also has their `profile_text_color` set to black. While other Twitter users have light or white banner images. So there was no easy way to ensure the text was readable without some kind of background. I also wanted to make sure the page controll was visible, otherwise the user would not know to page to see the description.
- [x] Code/architecture
   - [x] Created custom views for profile header and description
   - [x] Refactor tweet table view cell into XIB for reuse on profile scene
